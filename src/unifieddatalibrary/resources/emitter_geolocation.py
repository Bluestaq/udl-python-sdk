          id_rf_emitter: Optional identifier of the geolocated signal of interest RF Emitter for this
              observation. This ID can be used to obtain additional information on an RF
              Emitter object using the 'get by ID' operation (e.g. /udl/rfemitter/{id}). For
              example, the rfemitter object with idRFEmitter = abc would be queried as
              /udl/rfemitter/abc.

              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          orig_object_id: Optional identifier of the satellite used to identify and geolocate Emitter
              signals of interest of this observation. This may be an internal identifier and
              not necessarily a valid satellite number. Used when Emitter geolocation is done
              by a single satellite.

          orig_rf_emitter_id: Optional identifier of the emitter of interest for this observation. This may be
              an internal identifier and not necessarily a valid emitter Id.

          orig_sensor_id: Optional identifier provided by observation source to indicate the sensor
              identifier which produced this Emitter Geo Location. This may be an internal
              identifier and not necessarily a valid sensor ID. Used when Emitter geolocation
              is done by a single sensor.

          pass_group_id: Optional external identifier referencing the entity used in the calculation of
              the geolocation.

              ISO 8601 UTC with microsecond precision.

          sat_no: Satellite/catalog number of the on-orbit spacecraft used to identify and
              geolocate Emitter signals of interest of this detection. Used when Emitter
              geolocation is done by a single satellite.

          signal_of_interest: The name of the signal of interest.

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.

              /udl/rfemitter/abc.

          id_sensor: Unique identifier of the reporting sensor. This ID can be used to obtain
              additional information on a sensor using the 'get by ID' operation (e.g.

          origin: Originating system or organization which produced the data, if different from
              the source. The origin may be different than the source if the source was a
              mediating system which forwarded the data on behalf of the origin system. If
              null, the source may be assumed to be the origin.

          orig_object_id: Optional identifier of the satellite used to identify and geolocate Emitter
              signals of interest of this observation. This may be an internal identifier and
              not necessarily a valid satellite number. Used when Emitter geolocation is done
              by a single satellite.

          orig_rf_emitter_id: Optional identifier of the emitter of interest for this observation. This may be
              an internal identifier and not necessarily a valid emitter Id.

          orig_sensor_id: Optional identifier provided by observation source to indicate the sensor
              identifier which produced this Emitter Geo Location. This may be an internal
              identifier and not necessarily a valid sensor ID. Used when Emitter geolocation
              is done by a single sensor.

          pass_group_id: Optional external identifier referencing the entity used in the calculation of
              the geolocation.

          received_ts: The time representing the mean of the constituent single-burst observations in

          sat_no: Satellite/catalog number of the on-orbit spacecraft used to identify and
              geolocate Emitter signals of interest of this detection. Used when Emitter
              geolocation is done by a single satellite.

          signal_of_interest: The name of the signal of interest.

          tags: Optional array of provider/source specific tags for this data, where each
              element is no longer than 32 characters, used for implementing data owner
              conditional access controls to restrict access to the data. Should be left null
              by data providers unless conditional access controls are coordinated with the
              UDL team.
